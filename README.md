## Dissertation and Thesis Template

This template, compliant with PUC-SP's suggested standards for dissertations and theses, is suitable for documents in Brazilian Portuguese and APA style. You can find it in the `dissertation_thesis_template` folder.

It includes various LaTeX resources that can serve as learning material and be adapted to your needs.

The bibliography file, `library.bib`, is formatted in BibLaTeX and is located in the `post-textual` folder. 

If your reference manager is [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/), you can export your library to BibLaTeX with the following procedure:

1. Open Zotero;
2. Go to `File` → `Export library...`;
3. Select the `BibLaTeX` format;
4. Click `OK`;
5. Name the file as `library.bib`, choose a folder and click `Save`.

Replace the file in the `post-textual` folder with the new one.

Other reference managers can be used, following a similar procedure.
